### Brand Identity

How do you want other people to think about your business? Are you fun and friendly, eco-conscious, serious? A clear brand identity is the cornerstone of a successful business and something as simple as a font choice can ruin your credibility, so it's important to spend some time focusing on how you look to the rest of the world.

### Custom Web Design

When everything starts to look the same it's easy for users to stop being able to tell you apart from your competition. True, there are best practices that inform some fundamental design choices, but how do you make sure you stand out from your competitors and appeal to your audience? A custom design can lift your business out of the sea of templated websites and have an advantage on the internet.

### Bespoke Website

I build all of my websites by hand because I don't believe there's a one-size-fits-all solution out there, and you want to be certain that the website you have is designed specifically with you in mind rather than trying to get your business to fit into someone else’s box. It also means there are never any knowledge gaps in knowing exactly how your website works!

### Digital Consultancy

There's an almost overwhelming number of options out there when it comes to designing, building and maintaining a website. Should you use a website builder or go custom? Shared server hosting or CDN? Who should I run my email campaign through? Don't tear your hair out going down the internet rabbit hole, let me do the legwork for you!

### Pricing

We all know you get what you pay for. I’m not the cheapest there is, but that’s because I offer a quality service and I’m more than happy to be held up to scrutiny about that. Ultimately, it all comes down to what you want to achieve as to how much it’ll come to: a one-page website with a contact form is a different beast altogether to a 20-page E-commerce site with stock control, admin & a brand identity, so honestly it could be £500 or £5000...

I'm more than happy to discuss what you want and what it takes to get there. I'll give you an idea of either what you'll get for your money or how much it'll cost for exactly what you need. Then the decision is yours!
