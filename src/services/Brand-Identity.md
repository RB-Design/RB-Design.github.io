How do you want to be perceived out there on the wide world web? Are you sober and serious or are you fun and friendly? It goes without saying that a funeral director probably shouldn't be using the same colours and fonts as a bouncy castle rental company.

It's important you make sure you understand not only how you want to represent yourself as a business but also who your target audience is. take Monzo bank for example. They're dealing with your money so their site uses a lot of blue (traditionally associated with trust and reliability). However, as they're an app first business they need to make sure they're appealing to a younger audience so the card itself is a hot coral pink and you see splashes of this throughout the site as an accent that complements the blue.

So you see, there's a lot to think about when it comes to your brand, not just whether you have a cool looking logo!
