After working with Richard, we immediately began seeing business from our site, taking bookings and handling enquiries, such that our website very quickly became the dominant source of our business. Richard was careful to prepare us with all the necessary response protocols and site handling skills; we were never left to fend for ourselves, he was always at armâ€™s length if we needed him.
