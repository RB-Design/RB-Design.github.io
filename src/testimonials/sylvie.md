Rich was an absolute pleasure to work with. He is a gifted communicator (especially to us non-techy people!). Above all else, Rich is a highly personable and very reliable individual, and these characteristics ensured that we maintained an incredibly smooth working relationship throughout the process. We wholeheartedly recommend his services to anyone seeking assistance with anything related to website design.
